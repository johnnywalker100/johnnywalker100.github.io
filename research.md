In recent years, there have been numerous fatal accidents involving captains falling overboard and not wearing a lanyard. This year, a boat in New Jersey struck a wake and threw both of the men off, it circled around and ended up hitting an old man. Two months earlier, a similar thing occurred in Indiana when a man was thrown off the boat and the propeller ended up killing a 71 year old man.
